# Inky Armando - website

We must define an structure first, so maybe we can do something like:

1. Header.
2. Jumbotron presentation.
3. Body.
    1. Background.
    2. Projects.
 4. Contact info - social media ( footer ).

Something like that must do it, so we are talking about a web site cause I'll have multiple pages, one for each project, so maybe I'll need some kind of backend or a simple storage system, probably just a json hardcoded tbh lol.
